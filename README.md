### [MCmoderSD.de](https://www.GitHub.com/MCmoderSD/MCmoderSD.de/)
This repository hosts the source code for my personal website, encapsulated as an all-in-one Docker image. 
It serves as a comprehensive portfolio showcasing my skills in continuous integration and deployment automation.

#### Technologies Used
- **HTML**: The primary markup language for the website's structure.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the website, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive design.
- **Dockerfile**: Scripts for containerizing the application, making it easy to deploy and manage.
- **GitHub Actions**: Used for continuous integration and deployment automation through YAML configuration.

#### Purpose
The main purpose of this repository is to serve as my personal website. 
It demonstrates my ability to integrate various technologies and tools to build, deploy, and maintain a web application.

#### Key Features
- **Workflow Automation**: Utilizes GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). This includes building the Docker image and deploying updates seamlessly.
- **Docker Hosting**: The website is hosted within a Docker container, providing a consistent environment across different deployment platforms. The container runs behind a reverse proxy for enhanced performance and security.
- **Auto-Update with Watchtower**: Watchtower is used to monitor the Docker container for updates. Whenever an update is available, Watchtower automatically pulls the latest version and restarts the container to apply the update without downtime.
- **Multi-Arch Image**: The Docker image is a multi-architecture image, supporting amd64, arm64, and other architectures. This is essential as the Docker host is a Raspberry Pi at my home.
- **Optimized Performance**: The Docker image is very slim and performant, requiring minimal space and resources to run efficiently.

### [JSQL-Driver](https://www.GitHub.com/MCmoderSD/JSQL-Driver/)
This repository hosts the source code for a simple Java SQL driver designed to connect to SQL databases, compatible with MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL. 
It is built to provide a straightforward and efficient way to interact with SQL databases using Java.

#### Technologies Used
- **Java**: The primary programming language used for developing the SQL driver.
- **GitHub Actions**: Used for continuous integration and deployment automation through YAML configuration.

#### Purpose
The main purpose of this repository is to offer a minimalistic and efficient SQL driver for Java applications. 
It showcases the ability to create, build, and deploy a Java-based library that can be seamlessly integrated into other projects.

#### Key Features
- **Automated Build and Deployment**: Utilizes GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). This includes building the JAR file and deploying it to my Sonatype Nexus OSS Maven Repository, a self-hosted repository for distributing Maven dependencies.
- **Workflow Automation**: The GitHub Actions workflow compiles the Java code, packages it into a JAR file, and deploys it to the Sonatype Nexus OSS Maven Repository, ensuring that every commit is automatically built and deployed.
- **Release Management**: Automatically generates a release on GitHub with the built JAR file and its hashes, providing an added layer of security by allowing users to verify the authenticity and integrity of the downloaded files.
